# Revision of ALT1 – a website interacting with an SQL database

This tutorial covers the creation of an interactive website including retrieval of data from a relational database (sql).  

The database contains existing data produced from an ALT2 revision tutorial.

Remix a copy for yourself to walk through the stages of how it was created.  When you remix the project you will get a copy of the finished artefact.  However, it is important to understand the design process and testing methodologies used whilst developing the artefact originally.   Hence, you should use the tutorial to walk through the stages one at a time.
The tuturial can be found in the file "Tutorial.md".
